pyXe has been developed to improve the diffraction-strain analysis workflow and
ease some of the bottlenecks observed both during and after synchrotron X-ray
diffraction (SXRD) experiments.

During experiments at these type of large scale facilities it is important to
visualize the incoming data in as close to real time as possible. This allows
for a tight feedback loop and efficient optimization of  experimental
parameters. The first aim of the pyXe package is to therefore provide a fast,
simple and consistent interface for the analysis of data from different
synchrotron sources and setups (including monochromatic and energy dispersive
detectors). The data from different source/setup combinations is output in
different forms and the interface is designed to be easily extensible.

For a monochromatic setup the pyFAI package is leveraged to carry out the
azimuthal integration required to simplify the Debye-Scherrer cones to 1D
line profiles (as a function of azimuthal angle). The 1D data is directly
available in the case of an energy-dispersive (white beam) detector. From
these 1D profiles single peak or full profile (Pawley) fitting is possible,
with the associated strain being calculated from a strain free interplanar
or lattice spacing. Peak fitting routines can be run over 1D, 2D and 3D data
sets. The resultant strain data can be further interrogated to allow for the
calculation of principal and shear strains.

The data exploration and analysis procedure is designed to be reproduceable and
can be stopped and restarted at any point, with data being stored in the hdf5
file format. A number of data visualization tools are provided and can be built
upon, with the aim being that publication quality figures can be achieved with
minimal difficulty.
